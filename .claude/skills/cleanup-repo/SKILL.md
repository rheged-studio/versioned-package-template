# cleanup-repo

Remove merged Git worktrees and branches, then run a filesystem-hygiene pass —
each pass behind its own confirmation gate, with a `--dry-run` preview.

The branch/worktree pass mirrors the behaviour of the `/cleanup-branches`
slash command it was extracted from. The filesystem-hygiene pass (recursively-empty
directories and orphan `node_modules/`) is new to this skill. See
[`references/design-notes.md`](references/design-notes.md) for the naming
rationale and the deliberately-deferred future extensions.

## Configuration

Five knobs live in [`config.json`](config.json) beside this file. Read it at the
start of a run and use its values throughout. Edit your copied `config.json` to
match the consuming repo:

| Key                      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Default           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `linearTeamName`         | Linear team **name** used to resolve the live `Done` state. Use the name, not the key — the key is renamed over time but the name is stable.                                                                                 | `"Rheged Studio"` |
| `issueKeys`              | Team-key prefixes that may appear in branch names. The issue-ID regex is built from these.                                                                                                                                   | `["A"]`           |
| `mainBranch`             | The trunk a branch must be merged into to count as merged — both passes diff against `origin/<mainBranch>`. Set it for repos whose trunk is `master`, `develop`, or similar.                                                 | `"main"`          |
| `protectedBranches`      | Branches that are **never** deleted, locally or remotely.                                                                                                                                                                    | `["main"]`        |
| `linearWritebackDefault` | Seeds the yes/no default of the Step 10 Linear `Done` writeback prompt — `"yes"` pre-fills yes, `"no"` pre-fills no. The interactive gate always stays; this never auto-applies. Absent or unrecognised → treated as `"no"`. | `"no"`            |

Build the issue-ID regex **deterministically**: escape each key's regex
metacharacters, and when there is more than one key wrap the alternation in
`(?:…)` so the `-\d+` binds to all of them — `\b(?:A|B)-\d+\b`, never the naive
join `\bA|B-\d+\b` (which parses as `\bA` _or_ `B-\d+\b`). A single key needs no
wrapper: `\bA-\d+\b`. With no keys configured, match nothing. This mirrors the
canonical `buildIssueRe` in the repo-root `lib/issue-keys.mjs`, which
`pnpm vendor:sync` copies into each consuming bundle (ADR-0004). Match it
against the **upper-cased** branch name (branches like `asw-7-as-acquired` carry
the key in lower case).

If the Linear MCP server is not available, skip the Linear status check and the
optional `Done` writeback silently — they are not required for branch cleanup.

## Usage modes

**Dry run** — preview everything, change nothing:

```bash
cleanup-repo --dry-run
```

**Normal** — preview, then delete after confirmation:

```bash
cleanup-repo
```

**Scope flags** — run only one pass when you don't want the other (mutually
exclusive):

```bash
cleanup-repo --branches-only   # branch/worktree pass only; skip the filesystem pass
cleanup-repo --fs-only         # filesystem pass only; skip branches/worktrees
```

These are skill invocations, not a standalone CLI: `cleanup-repo` is the skill and
the flags are passed through `$ARGUMENTS` (the agent reads them from there), so a
bare `cleanup-repo --dry-run` in a shell does nothing.

The branch/worktree pass and the filesystem pass are confirmed **separately** (Step
8). Their blast radii differ — a branch prune is recoverable (reflog, re-push, the
PR still exists) and an orphan `node_modules/` reinstalls, but a swept
empty-directory tree may be something you meant to keep — so you can accept one pass
and decline the other. `--dry-run` short-circuits before any confirmation;
`--branches-only` / `--fs-only` drop the other pass (and its preview and prompt)
entirely.

## Process

> **Scope flags.** Under `--branches-only`, skip Step 5 (filesystem detection) and
> the filesystem removal — run only the branch/worktree pass. Under `--fs-only`,
> skip Steps 2–4 and 9.1–9.4 (worktrees, branches, remotes, Linear) — run only the
> filesystem pass. The two flags are mutually exclusive; with neither, both passes
> run and are confirmed separately (Step 8).

### Step 1 — Fetch latest from remote

```bash
git fetch --prune origin
```

### Step 2 — Identify worktrees to remove

```bash
git worktree list
```

- List all worktrees except the main repository directory (the primary working
  directory is never removed).
- Identify worktrees whose branch is fully merged into the trunk
  (`origin/<mainBranch>`, default `origin/main`).
- Identify worktrees in detached-HEAD state — treat as abandoned, safe to remove.
- Identify worktrees with uncommitted changes: `git -C <path> status --porcelain`
  non-empty. These are surfaced separately in Step 6 and **never removed
  automatically** — the user handles them manually (`git worktree remove --force
<path>` once they have moved or discarded the work).
- Worktree location is irrelevant to detection; `git worktree list` enumerates
  them wherever they live (e.g. a gitignored `.claude/worktrees/<branch>/`).

### Step 3 — Identify merged branches (two-pass)

**Pass 1 — Git-merged branches:**

- Find local branches merged into the trunk:
  `git branch --merged origin/<mainBranch>` (default `origin/main`).
- Exclude every branch in `protectedBranches`.
- Determine which of those branches also still exist on the remote.

**Pass 2 — Squash-merged branches:**

A squash merge lands a single new commit on the trunk, so the branch's own commits
are never ancestors of `origin/<mainBranch>` and `git branch --merged` misses it.
For each local branch **not** caught in Pass 1 (and not protected):

```bash
gh pr list --head <branch-name> --base <mainBranch> --state merged \
  --json number,title,headRefOid --limit 1
```

`gh` auto-detects the repository from the current directory's remote, so no
`--repo` flag is needed.

- **`--base <mainBranch>` is required.** `gh pr list --head` does **not** filter on
  base on its own, so without it a branch merged into a _different_ base (a
  stacked/feature base, not the trunk) would be wrongly counted as merged-to-trunk
  and deleted. Scoping to `--base <mainBranch>` (default `main`) restricts the match
  to PRs actually merged into the trunk.
- A non-empty result means the branch has a merged-to-trunk PR. Record its `number`
  and `title` (for the summary) and its `headRefOid` (the exact commit the PR
  merged).
- **Guard against post-merge commits.** Compare the local tip to the merged PR's
  head: `git rev-parse <branch-name>` vs `headRefOid`.
  - **Equal** → the branch is fully merged; add it to the squash-merged cleanup
    list (Step 9.3 force-deletes it, which is safe because the tip matched).
  - **Not equal** → the local branch carries commits added **after** the PR merged.
    Do **not** delete it; add it to a _"Skipped — local tip ahead of merged PR"_
    group so a plain `-D` can't silently discard unpushed work.
- An empty result means the branch is genuinely unmerged — leave it alone.

### Step 4 — Check Linear issue status for merged branches

For each merged branch whose name contains an issue ID (extract with the regex
built from `issueKeys`, matched against the upper-cased branch name):

- Fetch the issue via `mcp__linear-server__get_issue`.
- Track any issue that is **not** in `Done` status.

Skip this step silently if the Linear MCP server is unavailable.

### Step 5 — Run the filesystem-hygiene detection

Run the bundled script against the repository root to get the candidate list.
It is read-only without `--apply`:

```bash
node scripts/filesystem-hygiene.mjs <repo-root> --json
```

Two paths here point at different places, so resolve each deliberately:

- `<repo-root>` is the **target repository** being cleaned — obtain it with
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. The script refuses to run against a root with no
  `.git` entry, so a mis-pointed root can't sweep arbitrary directories.
- `scripts/filesystem-hygiene.mjs` is **relative to this skill bundle** (where this
  `SKILL.md` lives), not to `<repo-root>`. If your working directory is the target
  repo, give the script its absolute bundle path.

It prints `{ "emptyDirs": [...], "orphanNodeModules": [...] }`:

- **`emptyDirs`** — top-most recursively-empty directories (no files anywhere in
  the subtree). Directories holding any file — including a `.gitkeep` /
  `.gitignore` placeholder — are left alone. `.git/` is never traversed.
- **`orphanNodeModules`** — `node_modules/` directories whose immediate parent has
  no `package.json` (strict; no workspace inference). Removing one re-installs is
  needed if the parent was not actually meant to be gone — which is why these are
  surfaced **separately**.

This detection is read-only and feeds the Step 6 preview. One subtlety: Step 9
removes worktrees **before** re-running the detection with `--apply`, so the apply
pass can additionally sweep a parent that becomes empty only once its worktrees are
gone (e.g. `.claude/worktrees/`). Such a directory won't appear in this pre-removal
detect output — predict it from the worktree-removal list and label it as a
post-removal sweep in the preview, so the user isn't surprised when `--apply`
removes it.

### Step 6 — Display everything to be deleted

Show clear, counted lists. Keep the filesystem groups separate so the user can
eyeball them:

```text
## Worktrees to Remove (3)
- /path/.claude/worktrees/A-7-as-acquired (merged)
- /path/.claude/worktrees/A-9-button-styling (squash-merged, PR #42)
- /path/.claude/worktrees/orphan-detached (detached HEAD)

## Worktrees Skipped — Uncommitted Changes (1)
- /path/.claude/worktrees/A-12-wip (merged, but `git status` is non-empty;
  remove manually with `git worktree remove --force <path>`)

## Local Branches to Delete (3)
- A-7-as-acquired (merged)
- A-9-button-styling (squash-merged, PR #42 "Fix button styling")
- chore-update-deps (merged)

## Local Branches Skipped — Tip Ahead of Merged PR (1)
- A-15-extra-tweaks (squash-merged PR #50, but local tip has commits added after
  the merge; delete manually with `git branch -D A-15-extra-tweaks` if they're
  disposable)

## Remote Branches to Delete (2)
- A-7-as-acquired
- A-9-button-styling

## Linear Issues Still Open (1)
- A-9 "Button styling" — currently In Review (branch: A-9-button-styling)

## Empty Directories to Remove (1)
- /path/.claude/worktrees   (predicted: empty once the worktrees above are removed)

## Orphan node_modules to Remove (1)
- /path/old-package/node_modules   (no sibling package.json)
```

### Step 7 — Dry-run handling

If `--dry-run` is set, STOP here. Print `DRY RUN MODE - No changes were made` and
exit without changing anything.

### Step 8 — Confirmation (normal mode only)

Confirm the two passes **separately** — their blast radii and reversibility differ,
so the user may accept one and decline the other:

1. **Branch/worktree pass** — ask `Delete these worktrees and branches (local +
remote)? (yes/no)`. On `no`, skip the worktree/branch/remote deletion (Step
   9.1–9.4) and the Linear `Done` writeback (Step 10).
2. **Filesystem pass** — ask `Remove these empty directories and orphan
node_modules? (yes/no)`. On `no`, skip the filesystem removal (Step 9.5).

Rules:

- Skip the prompt for a pass a scope flag already excluded (`--branches-only` drops
  prompt 2; `--fs-only` drops prompt 1) — that pass never ran or previewed.
- Skip the prompt for a pass that has nothing to do (all its Step 6 lists empty);
  note it and move on.
- If both passes are declined (or empty), exit without deleting.

Proceed to Step 9 with only the passes the user confirmed.

### Step 9 — Execute, in order

Order matters. Worktrees must go before their branches, and the filesystem pass
runs **after** worktree removal so a just-emptied worktree parent (e.g.
`.claude/worktrees/`) is swept in the same run.

1. **Remove worktrees** (skip the uncommitted-changes group from Step 6):

   ```bash
   git worktree remove <path>
   ```

2. **Prune stale worktree references:**

   ```bash
   git worktree prune
   ```

3. **Delete local branches** (skip this whole sub-step if the branch/worktree pass
   was declined or excluded by `--fs-only`):

   ```bash
   git branch -d <branch-name>   # Pass 1 (git-merged) — safe delete
   git branch -D <branch-name>   # Pass 2 (squash-merged) — force is safe ONLY for
                                 # branches whose local tip matched the merged PR's
                                 # headRefOid in Step 3
   ```

   Force-delete (`-D`) only the squash-merged branches confirmed in Step 3 — those
   whose local tip equalled the merged PR's `headRefOid`. Branches in the _"Skipped
   — local tip ahead of merged PR"_ group are **never** force-deleted here: they
   carry commits added after the merge, and `-D` would discard them. The base-scoped
   `gh pr list --base <mainBranch>` and the tip check together are what make the
   force safe; without them `-D` could drop a branch merged into a different base or
   one with unpushed work.

   The branch you are currently on — or one checked out in a worktree — cannot be
   deleted: `git branch -d` fails by design. The per-item error handling catches it
   and moves on, so it is auto-skipped; this is expected, not a failure.

4. **Delete remote branches** that still exist:

   ```bash
   git push origin --delete <branch-name>
   ```

5. **Filesystem-hygiene removal** — re-run the bundled script with `--apply`. It
   removes exactly the same set it detects and prints what it removed:

   ```bash
   node scripts/filesystem-hygiene.mjs <repo-root> --apply
   ```

   `<repo-root>` and the bundle-relative `scripts/` path resolve exactly as in
   Step 5 (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for the root; the script lives in this
   skill bundle). Removing an orphan `node_modules/` can leave its parent empty;
   that parent is intentionally left for a follow-up run rather than swept in this
   snapshot.

### Step 10 — Optional Linear `Done` writeback

If any Linear issues from Step 4 are not `Done`:

- Ask: `These Linear issues are linked to merged branches but aren't Done. Set
them to Done? (yes/no)`. Seed the default from `linearWritebackDefault` —
  `"yes"` pre-fills the prompt with yes, anything else — `"no"`, an absent key,
  or an unrecognised value — pre-fills no. The prompt is always shown and the
  answer always confirmed — the knob only moves the default, it never
  auto-applies. The default is `no` because Linear's GitHub integration normally
  handles this on PR merge, so the writeback exists only for the rare case where
  it didn't fire (e.g. the issue ID was added after the merge); a repo not wired
  to that integration can flip the default to `yes`.
- If yes:
  - Resolve the live `Done` state ID **once** via
    `mcp__linear-server__list_issue_statuses` with `team: <linearTeamName>` —
    state IDs are per-team and the team key changes over time, so pass the team
    _name_.
  - For each open issue, call `mcp__linear-server__save_issue` with
    `state: <Done state ID>`.
- If no, skip without changes.

### Step 11 — Summary

Report counts: worktrees removed, local branches deleted, remote branches
deleted, empty directories removed, orphan `node_modules/` removed, Linear issues
set to `Done` (if any). List the names of deleted items.

## Important rules

- **Dry-run** previews without deleting (`--dry-run`).
- **Confirmation required** before any deletion — the branch/worktree pass and the
  filesystem pass are confirmed **separately**, so each can be accepted or declined
  on its own.
- **Scope flags**: `--branches-only` runs only the branch/worktree pass; `--fs-only`
  runs only the filesystem pass (mutually exclusive).
- **Protected branches** (`protectedBranches`) are never touched.
- **Merged only**: a branch is deleted only if merged into the trunk
  (`origin/<mainBranch>`) via git ancestry **or** a merged GitHub PR whose **base is
  `<mainBranch>`** (squash merges). A squash-merged branch is force-deleted only
  when its local tip still matches the merged PR's head commit — a branch with
  post-merge commits is surfaced and skipped, never `-D`'d.
- **Worktrees first**, then branches; filesystem pass last.
- **Uncommitted worktrees** are never force-removed automatically.
- **`.git/` and the main worktree** are never touched.

## Error handling

- Skip (and report) any worktree or branch that fails to remove; continue with
  the rest.
- Skip remote branches that no longer exist (already deleted).
- If `gh pr list` fails for a branch (network, rate limit, auth), log a warning
  and continue — do not treat the branch as merged.
- If the Linear MCP server is unavailable, skip the Linear steps silently.

# changelog

Author, refresh, or repair the changelog entry for the current branch under
`changelog/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<slug>.md` — derive metadata, write the frontmatter and
grouped body, run the deterministic enrichment scripts, and validate against the
changelog contract.

## Install

From any consumer repo:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/rheged-studio/agent-skills --skill changelog --agent claude-code --agent cursor --copy
```

`--copy` writes real files so the bundle is portable. Don't use `-g` / `--global`
— the installation should live in the consumer repo.

## Configure

This skill ships only [`config.example.json`](config.example.json), a neutral
template — the per-skill `config.json` is generated on install, not vendored.
`issueKeys` and `linearWorkspaceSlug` are **required and have no default** — a
missing `config.json`, or either key absent, makes the scripts **fail loudly**
rather than silently inherit another org's identity (which would emit wrong
issue-ID detection and Linear links in a foreign repo). Run the
`initialise-skills` skill to generate `config.json`, or copy
[`config.example.json`](config.example.json) to `config.json` and set them for
your organisation. The remaining keys are structural and keep generic, overridable
defaults.

| Key                   | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                             | Default                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `issueKeys`           | Team-key prefixes used to recognise issue IDs in the branch and body.                                                                                                                               | **required**                       |
| `linearWorkspaceSlug` | Linear workspace slug for issue links (`https://linear.app/<slug>/issue/<id>`).                                                                                                                     | **required**                       |
| `baseBranch`          | Trunk the branch diff is taken against (`origin/<baseBranch>`); `BASE_REF` env overrides per-run.                                                                                                   | `"main"`                           |
| `changelogDir`        | Directory the dated entries live in (scanned and validated).                                                                                                                                        | `"changelog"`                      |
| `affectedPackages`    | Monorepo gate. When `true`, emit and maintain `affected_packages` from the branch diff; single-package repos leave it `false`, which omits the field and makes `set-affected-packages.mjs` a no-op. | `false`                            |
| `packageRoots`        | Monorepo dir prefixes mapping `<root>/<x>/…` → package `<x>` for `affected_packages`.                                                                                                               | `["apps", "packages", "services"]` |
| `fallbackPackage`     | Package name for changed paths matching no `packageRoots` prefix.                                                                                                                                   | `"infrastructure"`                 |

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥22** for the bundled scripts. They use **only Node built-ins** — no
  `npm install`, no build step.
- The **`git` CLI** for branch and diff analysis.
- **pnpm** _only_ for the optional `preflight-changelog-ci.mjs` step (Node/lockfile
  CI-parity). Skip that step if your repo doesn't use pnpm.

## What it does

Detects the branch's existing entry (idempotent update-vs-create), derives the
metadata from git and the diff, writes the frontmatter + grouped/categorised body,
runs the enrichment scripts (`set-affected-packages.mjs`, `add-links.mjs`), and
validates with `validate-changelog.mjs`. `created_at` is set once and never
overwritten; `stats` and the post-merge fields are left blank for the post-merge enricher.

Run standalone via `/changelog` (writes/validates, leaves the entry **uncommitted**)
or as the changelog step inside a ship flow. See [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) for the
six-step process and [`references/changelog-contract.md`](references/changelog-contract.md)
for the full frontmatter schema and field-ownership rules.

## Scripts and tests

The bundled scripts are the **zero-dependency `.mjs`** set (Node built-ins only),
deliberately chosen so the bundle is drop-in with no tooling. The authoring scripts
the skill runs (`set-affected-packages`, `add-links`, `preflight-changelog-ci`,
`validate-changelog`) are the live author-time path. The finalisation/CI-gate
scripts (`finalise-changelog` for npm targets, `enrich-changelog` for deploy
targets, `check-changelog-completeness`) remain in the bundle as **published
source**, but the estate now runs that logic from the published
[`@rheged-studio/changelog-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rheged-studio/changelog-core)
package — invoked in-repo by the shared `reusable-changelog-enrich.yml`
(`mode: enrich | finalise`) and by CI (`changelog-core validate` /
`check-completeness`), not by a central orchestrator or cron. See the SKILL.md
"Implementation" section for detail. Every script takes `--help` (usage, exit 0)
and `--self-test` (an offline smoke test of its pure logic). Their **unit tests are
maintained in the [`agent-skills`](https://github.com/rheged-studio/agent-skills)
repo**, not bundled into the skill — see that repo's test suite for coverage.

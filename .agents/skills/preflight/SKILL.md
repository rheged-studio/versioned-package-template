# preflight

Change-gated, branch-scoped lint preflight. It lints only the categories relevant
to `origin/<base>...HEAD`, on changed paths only — not a whole-repo `pnpm lint` —
then classifies each violation as **introduced** (on a line this branch added or
changed) or **pre-existing** (already there, in a file the branch happens to
touch).

This skill is the single source of truth for the preflight loop. It is invoked
two ways:

- **Standalone** (`/preflight`) — a quick "will my branch pass scoped lint?"
  check, leaving any fixes in the working tree.
- **Inside a ship flow** (e.g. `/send-it`) — the lint gate that runs after commits
  and before the changelog/push steps.

All bundled scripts use only Node built-ins — no `npm install`, no build step.
They operate on the **consumer repo's root** (run them from the repo root, where
`git` resolves the branch diff).

## Running it

1. Make sure the base branch is up to date: `git fetch origin <base>` (the base is
   auto-detected — see Configuration).
2. Run the preflight: `node skills/preflight/scripts/preflight.mjs` (append
   `--dry-run` to report categories and scoped file lists without classifying
   violations). `--dry-run` is a true preview — every linter reports `would-run`
   and nothing is written, including `.preflight-summary.json`.
3. Read `.preflight-summary.json` for the categories run and the violation counts
   (`passed`, `deferred`, `blocking`). Written only on a real run, not under
   `--dry-run`. It is a transient scratch artefact, never committed — consumer
   repos gitignore it (the `rheged-skills-setup` skill adds the entry when it
   reconciles a repo).

The script's exit code drives the loop:

- **Exit 0 — pass.** No introduced violations and every linter ran cleanly.
  Continue.
- **Exit 1 — introduced violations (blocking).** Run
  `node skills/preflight/scripts/lint-fix.mjs` on the branch-scoped paths, then
  re-run preflight. Repeat until introduced violations clear or the user aborts.
  (Inside a ship flow, commit the fixes; standalone, leave them in the working
  tree for the user to review and commit.) **Only introduced _errors_ block by
  default** — introduced ESLint **warnings** are reported as a non-blocking notice
  and don't fail the gate, matching `pnpm lint` / CI (which exit 0 on warnings).
  Set `blockOnWarnings: true` to gate on them too (see Configuration).
- **Exit 2 — pre-existing violations only.** Show the list and ask the user to
  choose:
  - **Fix now** — apply the fixes, (commit if shipping), re-run preflight.
  - **Defer** — open a debt issue in Linear (see **Debt-issue create** below).
    After creating (or refusing), decide whether to continue or abort.

Exit 1 can also signal a linter that failed to run (non-zero exit with no
parseable violations) — inspect its stderr; this is blocking too.

## Categories

Each category is gated on what the branch changed (mirrors CI path triggers,
narrower scope):

| Category     | Runs when                                                                   | Skipped when                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ESLint       | Branch diff includes lintable code or eslint/tsconfig config paths          | Markdown-only or non-lintable changes                                                                               |
| markdownlint | Branch diff includes `.md` / `.mdx` (respecting repo ignores)               | No markdown changes; warns and skips if the `markdownlint-cli2` binary is missing                                   |
| actionlint   | Branch diff includes `.github/workflows/*.yml` or `.github/actionlint.yaml` | No workflow changes; config-only changes lint all tracked workflows; warns and skips if `actionlint` binary missing |

ESLint runs per workspace (via `pnpm --filter`), plus a root/scripts bucket.
Typecheck, tests, and framework checks (e.g. `astro check`) are **not** part of
preflight — they stay in CI.

## Standalone vs inside a ship flow

- **Standalone (`/preflight`)** does the lint preflight and the exit-code loop,
  then **reports**. On introduced violations it may run
  `node skills/preflight/scripts/lint-fix.mjs` and re-run, but it leaves fixes
  **in the working tree** — it never commits, writes a changelog, pushes, or opens
  a PR.
- **Inside `/send-it`** the same loop runs as the lint gate (after commits, before
  changelog work); fixes are committed so the branch is clean before the changelog
  is written. The changelog and its validation are **separate gates owned by the
  ship flow** — they are not part of this skill.

## Configuration

The two repo-specific inputs are auto-detected — a consuming repo edits nothing in
the common case:

- **Linted workspaces** are derived from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` plus each package's
  `package.json`: a workspace is included only if it declares a `lint` script. This
  auto-excludes intentionally-unlinted workspaces and non-package directories
  without a hand-maintained list.
- **Base branch** is detected from `origin/HEAD` (e.g. `main`, `master`,
  `develop`), falling back to `main` when that symbolic ref is absent.

To override either, add a `preflight.config.json` at the **consumer repo root**
(a [`config.example.json`](config.example.json) ships beside this file as a
template):

```json
{
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "blockOnWarnings": false,
  "workspaces": {
    "web": { "filter": "@acme/web", "prefix": "apps/web/" }
  },
  "linearTeamName": "",
  "debtProject": ""
}
```

Any key may be supplied on its own; the others are still auto-detected/defaulted.
Use the override for non-pnpm repos, deliberate exclusions, or nested workspace
globs the detector does not expand.

- **`blockOnWarnings`** (default `false`) — whether introduced ESLint
  warning-severity findings block the gate. Off by default, preflight blocks only
  on introduced **errors** (and linters that fail to run); introduced warnings are
  surfaced non-blockingly, matching `pnpm lint` / CI semantics. Set `true` for
  repos that want warn-level findings the branch adds to gate as well.
  markdownlint/actionlint findings always block — the warn/error split is
  ESLint-only.
- **`linearTeamName`** / **`debtProject`** — agent-facing keys for the Exit 2
  **Defer** path (the lint scripts ignore them). Both must be non-empty to mint a
  debt issue; see **Debt-issue create**. Empty disables debt-create (tell the
  user to set them, or choose Fix now) — never file with no project.

### Debt-issue create

When the user chooses **Defer** on Exit 2, mint a Linear debt issue only when
both `linearTeamName` and `debtProject` are set in the repo-root
`preflight.config.json` (read that file; empty / missing keys mean debt-create
is disabled). Fail closed:

1. If either key is empty, or the Linear MCP server is unavailable → **do not**
   call `save_issue`. Tell the user to set `linearTeamName` + `debtProject` (or
   choose Fix now). Skip silently only when MCP is unavailable and they still
   want to continue without tracking.
2. Resolve the team by **name** (`linearTeamName`) and the project via
   `list_projects` (`debtProject` as name, id, or slug). On a miss → **do not**
   call `save_issue`; fail loudly with the unresolved value.
3. On a hit → call `save_issue` with `team`, `project` (always), a title/description
   covering the pre-existing violations, assignee = the maintainer, and a link to
   the branch/PR context. Never omit `project`.

## Implementation

The bundled scripts live beside this file under
[`scripts/`](scripts/) and are invoked directly with `node` — no `pnpm` aliases,
no `npm install`:

- `scripts/preflight.mjs` — the change-gated preflight and exit-code contract.
- `scripts/lint-fix.mjs` — scoped `eslint --fix` / `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` on the
  branch-changed paths.
- `scripts/classify-lint.mjs` — parse + classify violations as introduced vs
  pre-existing.
- `scripts/lib/{scope,diff-lines,paths}.mjs` — shared helpers (workspace/base-branch
  detection, diff-line mapping, path normalisation).

They have no external npm dependencies (Node built-ins only).

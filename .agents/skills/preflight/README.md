# preflight

Change-gated, branch-scoped lint preflight: lint only the categories a branch
touched (ESLint / markdownlint / actionlint) on `origin/<base>...HEAD` changed
paths, classify each violation as **introduced** vs **pre-existing**, and drive a
fix/defer loop via an exit-code contract (0 pass, 1 introduced/blocking, 2
pre-existing only).

## Install

From any consumer repo:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/rheged-studio/agent-skills --skill preflight --agent claude-code --agent cursor --copy
```

`--copy` writes real files so the bundle is portable. Don't use `-g` / `--global`
— the install should live in the consumer repo.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥22 (per the package's `engines`) for the bundled scripts — **no npm
  dependencies**, Node built-ins only, no build step. If the consumer repo pins a
  Node major (`.nvmrc`, or an exact `engines.node` such as `24.x`), the active
  Node must match it — preflight exits 1 with a switch hint otherwise.
- The `git` CLI, for the branch/diff analysis.
- The consumer repo's own **ESLint** and **markdownlint-cli2** (invoked via
  `pnpm exec`), with their configs in place. preflight lints with your toolchain;
  it does not bundle linters.
- **actionlint** is optional: preflight warns and skips workflow linting if the
  binary isn't on `PATH`.
- The Linear MCP server is **optional**: the deferred-debt-issue step is skipped
  when it is unavailable, or when `linearTeamName` / `debtProject` are unset in
  root `preflight.config.json` (fail closed — never file without a project).

## Configure

Both repo-specific inputs **auto-detect**, so most repos configure nothing:

- **Linted workspaces** come from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + each package's `lint`
  script (a workspace without a `lint` script is excluded automatically).
- **Base branch** comes from `origin/HEAD`, falling back to `main`.

To override either, drop a `preflight.config.json` at your **repo root**. A
[`config.example.json`](config.example.json) ships as a template:

```json
{
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "blockOnWarnings": false,
  "workspaces": {
    "web": { "filter": "@acme/web", "prefix": "apps/web/" }
  },
  "linearTeamName": "",
  "debtProject": ""
}
```

Any key may be supplied on its own; the others are still auto-detected/defaulted.
Use the override for non-pnpm repos, deliberate exclusions, or nested workspace
globs the detector does not expand.

- **`blockOnWarnings`** (default `false`) — whether introduced ESLint
  **warning**-severity findings gate the ship. Off by default, preflight matches
  `pnpm lint` / CI, which exit 0 on warnings: introduced warnings are reported as
  a non-blocking notice but don't fail the gate; only introduced **errors** (and
  linters that fail to run) block. Set `true` to also block on the warn-level
  findings the branch introduces. markdownlint/actionlint findings always block —
  those tools exit non-zero on any finding, so the warn/error split is
  ESLint-only.
- **`linearTeamName`** / **`debtProject`** — required for the Exit 2 **Defer**
  debt-issue path. Both must be set; empty disables debt-create (never file a
  project-less issue). The lint scripts ignore these keys — they are agent-facing
  only. See [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md#debt-issue-create).

## What it does

Run from the repo root:

```bash
node skills/preflight/scripts/preflight.mjs            # the gate
node skills/preflight/scripts/preflight.mjs --dry-run  # report scope only
node skills/preflight/scripts/lint-fix.mjs             # scoped --fix pass
```

`preflight.mjs` writes `.preflight-summary.json` (categories run, introduced vs
pre-existing counts) and exits `0` / `1` / `2` per the contract above. See
[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) for the full loop, including how a standalone `/preflight`
run differs from the lint gate inside a ship flow.

# release-status

Diagnose the **release-please** pipeline and report why a release did or didn't
fire — **read-only**. The skill gathers four independent signals via `gh` and
`git`, prints a structured report, and surfaces the remediation for each. It
**writes nothing**: no commits, no labels, no PR edits, no releases.

## Relationship to `/send-it`

This is a **sibling of `send-it`, not invoked by it**. `send-it` is the pre-merge
ship flow — it stops at **In Review** (opens the PR, transitions the Linear
issue). `release-status` picks up **after merge**: it inspects the state of
`main`, the release PR, and the tags to explain what the release machinery is
doing. The two never call each other. This skill may reference `send-it` in prose
(e.g. how `/send-it` composes a Conventional-Commit PR title from branch
commits), but it never runs it. Version preview itself reads **commits since the
last tag** (merge commits excluded) — the same per-commit signal release-please
uses under multi-commit history (A-824) — not merged PR titles.

## What it inspects

| Signal                           | What it answers                                                                                                              | How to read / fix it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Version preview**              | What bump and version would the Conventional-Commit subjects on commits since the last tag on `origin/<mainBranch>` produce? | `feat:`→minor, `fix:`/`perf:`/`revert:`→patch, `!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:`→major; `docs`/`chore`/`ci`/`refactor`/`test`/`build`/`style`→none. The strongest wins across **all** commits (merge commits excluded). A `feat:` later `revert:`ed in the same window still implies **minor** — no cancel/netting, matching release-please. `none` means nothing release-triggering has landed since the last tag — no release will cut. |
| **Release PR**                   | Is the `release-please--branches--main` PR open, and is its required check (`GO/NO GO`) green?                               | If open and green, the orchestrator can squash-merge it. If the check is pending/red, the merge is blocked — chase that check. If none is open, release-please hasn't opened one (often because nothing release-triggering merged, or the pipeline is stalled — see below).                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Stale `autorelease: pending`** | Does the **last merged** release PR still carry the `autorelease: pending` label?                                            | This is the recurring stall: when a merged release PR keeps that label, release-please **aborts the next release** and the pipeline silently stops firing. Remediation: remove the label from that PR, then re-run the orchestrator (or wait for its cron tick).                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Tag-vs-version parity**        | Does a `v<package.json version>` tag already exist?                                                                          | This is the `release.yml` **version-vs-tag gate**. Tag exists → clean no-op (this version is already published). Tag missing → **publishing is pending** for that version (the gate would run the publish path on the next `main` push).                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Configuration

Four knobs live in `config.json` beside this file, vendored from the tracked
[`config.example.json`](config.example.json) template (the runtime `config.json`
is generated per consumer and is not itself tracked). Read `config.json` at the
start of a run and use its values throughout. Edit your copied `config.json` to
match the consuming repo.

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `mainBranch`        | The trunk release-please releases from.                                                                                    | `main`                           |
| `releaseBranch`     | The branch release-please opens its release PR on.                                                                         | `release-please--branches--main` |
| `requiredCheck`     | The exact name (incl. emoji) of the required status check the orchestrator polls before merging the release PR.            | `GO/NO GO`                       |
| `stalePendingLabel` | The label release-please applies to a release PR while a release is in flight; **stale** when it lingers on a _merged_ PR. | `autorelease: pending`           |

## Usage

Run the bundled helper. Its path is **relative to this skill's own directory**
(the one holding this `SKILL.md` and `config.json`) — resolve it from there, not
from the consuming repo's root, or the run fails with `ENOENT`.

**Human-readable report** — the default:

```bash
node scripts/release-status.mjs
```

**Machine-readable JSON** — for piping into another step:

```bash
node scripts/release-status.mjs --json
```

**Explicit repo** — when not run from inside the target checkout:

```bash
node scripts/release-status.mjs --repo rheged-studio/agent-skills
```

**Self-test** — run the bundled offline assertions (no network, no `gh`); a quick
way to confirm the script is healthy after install:

```bash
node scripts/release-status.mjs --self-test
```

`--help` (alias `-h`) prints the full usage.

## Process

### Step 1 — Confirm prerequisites

`gh auth status` must pass, and you must be inside (or pass `--repo` for) the target
repository. The helper reads the root `package.json` version, local tags, and
commits since the last tag on `origin/<mainBranch>` via `git`, and queries `gh`
for the open release PR and the last merged release PR's labels. Ensure
`origin/<mainBranch>` is up to date (`git fetch origin <mainBranch>`) before
trusting the version preview — the helper reads the local remote-tracking ref,
not a live GitHub query.

### Step 2 — Run the helper and read the four signals

```bash
node scripts/release-status.mjs
```

Read each block in order: **version preview**, **release PR**, **stale
`autorelease: pending`**, **tag-vs-version parity**. The helper only fetches and
prints — running it never changes anything.

### Step 3 — Interpret and advise (do not act)

Map the signals to a diagnosis. The common shapes:

- **"A release should have fired but didn't."** Check the stale-pending block
  first — a lingering `autorelease: pending` on the last merged release PR is the
  usual culprit (release-please aborts). If that's clear, check whether the version
  preview is `none` (nothing release-triggering merged) or whether the release PR
  is open-but-its-check-is-red (blocked at the gate).
- **"What version cuts next?"** Read the version-preview block: the bump and the
  resulting `next` version. `none` means no release.
- **"Is publishing pending?"** Read the parity block: a missing `v<version>` tag
  means the next `main` push runs the publish path; a present tag means a clean
  no-op.

### Step 4 — Report, with remediation

Summarise the diagnosis and surface the **remediation** the helper prints, but
**do not perform it** — this skill is advisory. For the stale-pending stall, the
fix is to remove the label from the merged release PR and re-run the orchestrator;
state that as the recommended next action and leave it to the human (or a
write-capable skill) to carry out.

## Important rules

- **Read-only / advisory.** Never remove a label, edit a PR, push a tag, or
  trigger a release. Gather, diagnose, and recommend — the human or a
  write-capable tool acts.
- **Not a `send-it` step.** This skill is never invoked by `send-it` and never
  invokes it. It inspects post-merge `main`; `send-it` stops at In Review.
- **Evidence, not guesses.** Report what the helper actually returned. If `gh`
  fails (auth, rate limit, permissions), report the failure — never treat
  "couldn't fetch" as "no release PR" or "no stall".
- **Mirror, don't import.** The bump rules are re-implemented here to keep the
  bundle standalone (ADR-0001 self-containment); they mirror `send-it`'s
  `derive-bump.mjs` and CLAUDE.md but never reach into a sibling skill.

## Error handling

- `gh auth status` fails → stop and tell the user to run `gh auth login`.
- The helper exits non-zero (rate limit, permissions, GraphQL/REST error) → report
  it; do not fabricate signals. Fall back to a manual `gh pr list --state merged
--head <releaseBranch> --json labels` to inspect the stale-pending label by hand.
- No tags yet (a never-released repo) → the version preview counts **all** merged
  PRs, and the parity block reports the first `v<version>` tag as pending. That is
  expected for the bootstrap release.
